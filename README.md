# Quaduck

Hello dear friend of excentric 3D-printers, may I introduce the Quaduck, 
an IDEX Printer with in Z completely independent Toolheads, based on the Voron Switchwire.
The naming originates from a long CAD session, where I started seeing a duck's face on a 
specific part of the printer. Therefore Switchwire meets ZIDEX meets ducks.

The files contain the first version of an assembly manual, but it is missing steps that 
are unchanged from SW or discovered after writing.

CAD is included hence beta, cause other projects needed the data.
Be aware, that I am NOT maintaining this repo on a daily basis, so it might be outdated. 

If you have questions, feel free to ask on discord. Add an # between my github-username.
